 * any other phantom-reachable objects from which that object is reachable.
 * At the same time or at some later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared

 * <p> In order to ensure that a reclaimable object remains so, the referent of
 * a phantom reference may not be retrieved: The <code>get</code> method of a
