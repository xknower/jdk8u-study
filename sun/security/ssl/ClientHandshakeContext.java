     * Allow unsafe server certificate change?
     *
     * Server certificate change during SSL/TLS renegotiation may be considered
     * unsafe, as described in the Triple Handshake attacks:
     *
     *     https://secure-resumption.com/tlsauth.pdf
     *
     * Endpoint identification (See
     * SSLParameters.getEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm()) is a pretty nice
     * guarantee that the server certificate change in renegotiation is legal.
     * However, endpoint identification is only enabled for HTTPS and LDAP
     * over SSL/TLS by default.  It is not enough to protect SSL/TLS
     * connections other than HTTPS and LDAP.
     *
     * The renegotiation indication extension (See RFC 5746) is a pretty
     * strong guarantee that the endpoints on both client and server sides
     * are identical on the same connection.  However, the Triple Handshake
     * attacks can bypass this guarantee if there is a session-resumption
     * handshake between the initial full handshake and the renegotiation
     * full handshake.
     *
     * Server certificate change may be unsafe and should be restricted if
     * endpoint identification is not enabled and the previous handshake is
     * a session-resumption abbreviated initial handshake, unless the
     * identities represented by both certificates can be regraded as the
     * same (See isIdentityEquivalent()).
     *
     * Considering the compatibility impact and the actual requirements to
     * support server certificate change in practice, the system property,
     * jdk.tls.allowUnsafeServerCertChange, is used to define whether unsafe
     * server certificate change in renegotiation is allowed or not.  The
     * default value of the system property is "false".  To mitigate the
     * compatibility impact, applications may want to set the system
     * property to "true" at their own risk.
     *
     * If the value of the system property is "false", server certificate
     * change in renegotiation after a session-resumption abbreviated initial
     * handshake is restricted (See isIdentityEquivalent()).
     *
     * If the system property is set to "true" explicitly, the restriction on
     * server certificate change in renegotiation is disabled.
